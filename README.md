# Chaotic Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-step forecasting algorithm for chaotic time series, focusing on identifying non-predictable points to minimize error propagation. The project is based on research conducted at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The algorithm predicts chaotic time series (e.g., Lorenz system) by:
1. Using **z-vectors** for irregular embeddings of time series data.
2. Introducing **non-predictable points** to skip high-uncertainty predictions.
3. Combining clustering and regression (e.g., gradient boosting) to optimize multi-step forecasts.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-step prediction with error control.
- Adaptive skipping of non-predictable points.
- Comparison of three approaches: single-step, multi-step, and step-isolated prediction.
